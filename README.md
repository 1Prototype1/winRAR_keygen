# WinRAR-Keygen

[中文版README](README.zh-CN.md)

## 1. What is WinRAR?

WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. 

It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats and unpack numerous archive file formats. 

WinRAR is not a free software. If you want to use it, you should pay to [__RARLAB__](https://rarlab.com/) and then you will get a license file named `rarreg.key`. 

This repository will tell you how WinRAR license file `"rarreg.key"` is generated. 

## 2. How is "rarreg.key" generated?

See [here](README.HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).
